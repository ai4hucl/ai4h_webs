# Open positions

<!--**Note: We currently don't have funding for additional PhD and postdoc positions. We can only welcome you if you have a fellowship. I'd be happy to support you after you apply to our group. Take a look at the [veni fellowship](https://www.nwo.nl/en/calls/nwo-talent-programme-veni-science-domain) or the Marie Curie fellowship (currently closed, next deadline probably Fall 2021, [here is last years call]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/h2020-wp1820-msca_en.pdf)).**-->


<!--

We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

You will have the chance to work on the grand challenges of condensed matter physics, often at the interface of instrumental design and new physics. You will be involved in determining the important and interesting questions, creating and improving instrumental setups, performing measurements, and making discoveries.

### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions
If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send me an [email](mailto:milan.allan@gmail.com). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ or _"Application Postdoc"_ in the subject line. If you are applying to a specific advertisement, note this in your email.


### Master projects for Leiden University students
If you are a Master student at Leiden University looking for a Master project, contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office.

### Bsc / Master students from elsewhere
If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree at Leiden University, see [mastersinleiden.nl](http://www.mastersinleiden.nl/programmes/physics/en/introduction). Sometimes, we take master students or summer interns if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades and a personal recommendation).

# Projects proposed by Ken (Kezhi) Li for Msc (2022-2023)

## HDS program

### 1. Personalised glucose estimation using physiological data (Shad data & oiho2020 data)
In this project, we will investigate how accurate can we estimate glucose data using retrospective data and real-time physiological data only. Students who have good machine learning & python skills are recommended to apply.

### 2. Glucose imputation from sparse measurements using AI (GP and GAN)
In this project, based on previous work we will continue to work on glucose imputation from sparse measurements (several times per day) using artificial intelligence algorithms, especially gaussian process, generative adversarial network (GAN) and other methods. Students who have good machine learning & python skills are recommended to apply.

### 3. Digital twin and visualisation of real patient flow in hospital
This [project](https://github.com/CorsixTH/CorsixTH) will focus on developing a digital twin (visualisation) of real patient flow in hospitals using electronic health record (EHR).
Students who have interests in EHR visualisation and have good programming skills are recommended to apply. (UCLH dummy data)

## HI program
### Web 3.0 in healthcare: future of health informatics?  (optional: add app development) 
In this project we will investigate and try to answer the following questions:
1. review of health 3: web 3 in healthcare
2. blockchain and DeFi in healthcare
3. apps development using healthcare data (option1: can develop an app e.g. insulin advisor; option2: a questionnaire about applications of healthcare 3) 
4. future of health informatics?
