# Projects proposed by Ken (Kezhi) Li for Msc (2023-2024):

## HDS program

### 1. Differential Diagnosis Support for Philadelphia-Negative Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs) using Machine Learning (with Samah)
Patients with Philadelphia-negative MPNs, including polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), often present with various symptoms, making it challenging to differentiate these conditions without additional investigations. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective management, long-term care, and prognostication.

Utilizing machine learning algorithms, we aim to develop a diagnostic support tool for differentiating between PV, ET, and PMF. By leveraging real-world data from our large quaternary center with over 400 patients, we will integrate various clinical parameters, including blood-related measurements, to enhance the accuracy of early diagnosis. This project will contribute to improving patient outcomes by providing a reliable and efficient tool for clinicians to navigate the complex landscape of MPN differentials.

### 2. Prognostic Modeling for Polycythemia Vera and Essential Thrombocythemia using Machine Learning (with Samah)
While prognostic models exist for myelofibrosis, there is currently a gap in prognostic modeling for polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia. Understanding the potential trajectory of these conditions is crucial for guiding treatment decisions and long-term care.

This project aims to fill the existing gap by leveraging machine learning to develop prognostic models specifically tailored for polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia. Using the extensive dataset from our quaternary center, we will explore commonalities and potential drivers of disease outcomes. This initiative not only enhances our understanding of local patient populations but also provides valuable insights for predicting disease progression, allowing for more personalized and effective management strategies.

### 3. Enhancing the digital twin and visualisation of real-time patient flow in hospital
This [project](https://github.com/CorsixTH/CorsixTH) will focus on developing a digital twin (visualisation) of real patient flow in hospitals using electronic health record (EHR).
Students who have interests in EHR visualisation and have good programming skills are recommended to apply. (UCLH dummy data)


### 4. Mental health/chatbot using LLM
The topic is "building a chatbot for mental health with guidance using Chatgpt". It requires that the student background is in computer science and has some programming experience. S/he should have enthusiasm in chatgpt and mobile health. 

### 5. Baby image generation from their 4D ultrasound images using generative AI
In this project, we will use generative AI tools to generate new born baby images from their 4D ultrasound images. Firstly, prompting engineering will studied to complete this task and different generative AI tools will be compared. Secondly, training image pairs will be incorporated to increase the quality of generated images. Finally, latest open source LLM will be investigated for this project. be The image dataset is from open public dataset. 

This project is good for students who want to practice their computer vision skills using the lates generative AI models. Python, Midjourney or DALLÂ·E, LLM or computer vision skills, webpage development experience would be beneficial to the project.

## HDS program

### 1. Personalised glucose estimation using physiological data (Shad data & oiho2020 data)
In this project, we will investigate how accurate can we estimate glucose data using retrospective data and real-time physiological data only. Students who have good machine learning & python skills are recommended to apply.

### 2. Glucose imputation from sparse measurements using AI (GP and GAN)
In this project, based on previous work we will continue to work on glucose imputation from sparse measurements (several times per day) using artificial intelligence algorithms, especially gaussian process, generative adversarial network (GAN) and other methods. Students who have good machine learning & python skills are recommended to apply.

### 3. Digital twin and visualisation of real patient flow in hospital
This [project](https://github.com/CorsixTH/CorsixTH) will focus on developing a digital twin (visualisation) of real patient flow in hospitals using electronic health record (EHR).

## HI program
### Web 3.0 in healthcare: future of health informatics?  (optional: add app development) 
In this project we will investigate and try to answer the following questions:
1. review of health 3: web 3 in healthcare
2. blockchain and DeFi in healthcare
3. apps development using healthcare data (option1: can develop an app e.g. insulin advisor; option2: a questionnaire about applications of healthcare 3) 
4. future of health informatics?
