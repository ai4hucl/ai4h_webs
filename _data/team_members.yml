  info: Paul Taylor now is a professor at the Institute of Health Informatics (IHI), University College London (UCL). He focuses on software to improve clinical decision making. Most of the applications he has looked at in recent years concern medical imaging, including the use of AI in mammography, in retinal imaging and chest radiographs. He is interested in seeing how recent advances in the application of neural networks to medical imaging can be most effectively applied to improve the quality of clinical decision making. He is also active in the use of large datasets, including image databases, to improve the understanding of disease and the effectiveness of treatment, using a large collection of data on ophthalmology from 28 different hospitals. <br> He teaches on the UCL Postgraduate programmes in Health Informatics, where he is responsible for the core module 'Essentials of Informatics for Health Systems', 'Health Data Analyics' and 'Health Data Science', and on the UCL MBBS programme.
