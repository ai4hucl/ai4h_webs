- title: "Going faster to see further: GPU-accelerated value iteration and simulation for perishable inventory control using JAX"
  image: jax_gpu.png
  description: This study employed GPU-accelerated value iteration implemented with the Python library JAX to efficiently find optimal replenishment policies for perishable inventory problems with large state spaces. This approach can address complex scenarios with over 16 million states and additional features, demonstrating superior performance compared to heuristic policies with a maximum optimality gap of 2.49%. The methodology has the potential to extend the application of value iteration to a broader range of operational research problems by leveraging consumer-grade GPU hardware for large-scale parallel computation.

  image: taiyu_npj_paper_2.png
  description: Applying a mixed effects logistic regression analysis to the outcomes of a six-week longitudinal study in 12 type 1 diabetes (T1D) adults using CGM and a clinically validated wearable sensor wristband (NCT ID NCT03643692), we identified several significant associations between physiological measurements and hypo- and hyperglycemic events measured an hour later. We proceeded to develop a new smartphone-based platform, ARISES (Adaptive, Real-time, and Intelligent System to Enhance Self-care), with an embedded deep learning algorithm utilizing multi-modal data from CGM, daily entries of meal and bolus insulin, and the sensor wristband to predict glucose levels and hypo- and hyperglycemia.

  image: zk_npj_paper.png
  description: Machine learning for hospital operations is under-studied. We present a prediction pipeline that uses live electronic health-records for patients in a UK teaching hospital’s emergency department (ED) to generate short-term, probabilistic forecasts of emergency admissions. A set of XGBoost classifiers applied to 109,465 ED visits yielded AUROCs from 0.82 to 0.90 depending on elapsed visit-time at the point of prediction. Patient-level probabilities of admission were aggregated to forecast the number of admissions among current ED patients and, incorporating patients yet to arrive, total emergency admissions within specified time-windows.

  image: taiyu_paper_1.png
  description: We propose a novel deep learning framework, Fast-adaptive and Confident Neural Network (FCNN). An attention-based recurrent neural network is used to learn representations from contiuous glucose monitoring input and forward a weighted sum of hidden states to an evidential output layer, aiming to compute personalized BG predictions with theoretically supported model confidence. The model-agnostic meta-learning is employed to enable fast adaptation for a new T1D subject with limited training data.

- title: "Deep reinforcement learning for platelet inventory management"
  image: zk_cdt.png
  description: Platelets are a blood component required for the formation of clots. Patients may receive a platelet transfusion to either stop or prevent bleeding. Hospital blood banks hold stock on-site to fill orders for patients, and place orders for replenishment with a regional blood bank that serves multiple hospitals. This stock management process is complicated by the need for compatibility between donor units and patients, and by the short shelf-life of platelets. We created an reinforcement learning environment based on a platelet replenishment scenario from the literature and demonstrate that DRL methods can be used to learn effective ordering policies.

Automatic analysis that can be carried out in (near) real-time would facilitate the incorporation of microcirulatory targets into clinical trials by enabling the impact of interventions to be quantified and enacted upon with the aim of optimising the microcirculation and improving patient outcomes.

#   description: We directly test the consistency of results from these three techniques by comparing data from the correlated metal Sr2RhO4. Using ARPES, STM, and quantum oscillations, we find good agreement for the Fermi surface topography and carrier effective masses. Hence, the apparent absence of such an agreement in other quantum materials, including the cuprates, suggests that the electronic states in these materials are of different, non-Fermi liquid-like nature.

# - title: Anisotropic energy gaps of iron-based superconductivity from intraband quasiparticle interference in LiFeAs
#   image: Pub_LiFeAs.png
#   description:
#     In contrast to earlier photoemission reports, we show that the gaps in iron based superconductors are not isotropic but modulated with angle.

#   image: Pub_nemat1.png
#   description:
#     We discovered an electronic nematic in the iron based superconductor Co-CaFe2As2! This state is by now confirmed and quite well characterized  by transport, photoemission, and more SI-STM experiments.
